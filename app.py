    ## Understanding Loan Amortization

    **Loan amortization** is the process of paying off a loan over time through regular payments. 
    Each payment is divided into two parts: **principal** and **interest**. 
    Initially, a larger portion of your payment goes towards interest, and as time goes on, more of it goes towards the principal. 
    This application helps you visualize this process.

    **Key Financial Concepts:**

    - **Principal:** The original loan amount.
    - **Interest:** The cost of borrowing money, expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR).
    - **Loan Term:** The duration over which the loan is repaid, typically in years.
    - **Fixed Payments:**  In most amortizing loans, payments are fixed, meaning you pay the same amount each period.

    **The Amortization Process:**

    This visualizer follows these steps to generate the amortization schedule:

    1.  **Calculate the Periodic Payment:**  Uses a standard formula to determine your fixed monthly payment.
    2.  **Determine Payment Components:** For each payment, calculate the interest portion based on the outstanding principal and the principal portion as the remainder of the payment.
    3.  **Update Loan Balance:**  Reduce the outstanding balance by the principal portion of the payment.
    4.  **Iterate Through the Loan Term:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each payment period until the loan is fully paid.

    Experiment with different loan parameters in the sidebar to see how they affect your amortization schedule!

        This chart visualizes how your monthly payment is divided between principal and interest over the life of the loan. 
        Notice how initially, interest payments are higher, but as you progress through the loan term, principal payments increase while interest payments decrease. 
        This is the core concept of loan amortization.
